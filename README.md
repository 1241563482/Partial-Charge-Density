# Partial-Charge-Density
Calculate the partial charge density based on the VASP.  
Detailed process: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/410514906  
Vasp official website: https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Band_decomposed_charge_densities  
This script is mainly used to seperate the spin-up and spin-down parts of the partial charge density.  
I'm fresh in python, so the script may takes a little time.  
Run this script by:  

    python PARCHARG.py  

Then input the PARCHG file name.
